In the first part of this work, an overview of cancer was provided, including its causes and the various types of treatments currently in use, with a particular emphasis on targeted therapies. Specifically, targeted therapies show promise because they help reduce the side effects that characterize all existing cancer treatments. The primary goal of these therapies is to directly target driver mutations, which play a crucial role in cancer development.

However, distinguishing between driver and passenger mutations is very difficult, as both types of mutations can occur simultaneously, and passenger mutations often outnumber driver mutations, making it challenging to identify which mutations significantly contribute to cancer progression. Instead, identifying driver pathways appears to be a promising approach, as multiple driver mutations in different genes can produce similar downstream effects, potentially causing various mutations to impact the same pathway across multiple samples.

Indeed, the second part of this work introduced multiple studies that aimed to develop approaches for identifying driver pathways. Specifically, the focus of this section was on the biological assumptions the various studies made, and how their developed metrics reflected those assumptions. Notably, mutual exclusivity among mutations within a driver pathway is one of the most frequently observed phenomena in genomic data, and many recent studies have formalized this biological characteristic in various ways.

Finally, the last part of this work examined the various algorithms employed by the studies introduced in the second part, illustrating how each study utilized its own developed measure of mutual exclusivity and other biological assumptions in order to identify driver pathways, and potentially discover new ones.

As a final note, future research may integrate emerging technologies, such as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_sequencing}{single-cell sequencing}, to further refine our understanding of driver pathways. Additionally, extending these algorithms to account for tumor heterogeneity and adaptive resistance mechanisms will be critical in expanding their applicability to diverse cancer types. The identification of driver pathways and the ability to measure key genomic phenomena hold significant promise for improving the precision of targeted therapies, which could lead to more powerful and personalized treatment, tailored to the unique genetic profiles of each patient.
