\chapter{Finding driver mutations} \label{chap:finding_driver_mutations}

Although the true explanation for mutual exclusivity remains unknown, and its therapeutic potential is still uncertain, this phenomenon is frequently observed in data and is thought to potentially lead to discoveries in cancer treatment. Existing approaches can be categorized into two types: \textbf{\textit{de novo}} approaches, which identify mutually exclusive patterns using only genomic data from patients, and \textbf{\textit{knowledge-based}} methods, which integrate the analysis with external \textit{a priori} information \cite{survey}. \textit{De novo} approaches might lack sufficient information as they do not utilize existing databases. Conversely, given that our understanding of gene and protein interactions in humans is still incomplete and many pathway databases fail to accurately represent the specific pathways and interactions present in cancer cells, \textit{knowledge-based} approaches may be limited by their dependence on existing data sources. Consequently, \textit{de novo} methods might yield new but potentially less accurate results, while \textit{knowledge-based} approaches may limit the discovery of novel biological insights \cite{multi-dendrix}.
